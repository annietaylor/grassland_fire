# grassland_fire
Notebooks used to process and analyze data collected in the field and from satellites in the comparison of three grassland sites: one managed with repeated controlled burning, one burned in a wildfire, and one without fire in the last 100 years.  

These notebooks represent the analysis associated with the _Ecological Applications_ publication titled 'Centering Amah Mutsun voices in the analysis of a culturally important, fire-managed coastal grassland.'
